        <p class="lead">Lastest Updated on July, 3 2020 10:45PM</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello guys, I know you're tired about studying in school and so bored about teacher that give you a lot of homework,
            memorize and prepare for examination and forgot everything, and this is the reasons why students haven't enjoted to learn in school? </p>
        <h3>Education system is outdated</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot be denied that education system is outdated because we must learn something useless or won't use in future.
            (e.g., Reciting the periodic table so, it's very difficult to memorize the whole periodic table, or reciting peotry.)
        </p>  
        <h3>Study for exam and then forget it</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Teacher right now taught the students to memorize the information for exam more than taught student to have creativity
             or inspire students to have passion to do in future. </p>
        <h3>Students have a lot of homeworks</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot be denied that everyday students have homework for every subjects to do for marks. Some students don't have time
            to find yourself that what do they want to do when they grow up. 
        </p>    
        <h3>Some parents</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some parents want their children to be doctor, engineer for money and didn't think their son what do son what to do, so
            parent push their children tuition and pay more money to expect child to get A+ grades. This case will have problem when children don't 
            want to be that parents want their children to be something that don't want to be. 
        </p>
        <h3>Follow the direction</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; People who have been taught in school is to follow the direction so, students have to download knowledge that 
            students don't know when it have to use in future and student must use skills to work in future but school don't teach? 
            Education system not let students make mistake otherwise, students will be punished.
